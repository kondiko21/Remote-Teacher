# Remote Teacher 
Remote Teacher is a demo app created for Olimpiada Innowacji Technicznych i Wynalazczości 2022. The app has been awarded in the category of "Software-hardware improvement".  

## About 
Remote Teacher has been created as a tool for improving remote learning. It has given the possibility of an easy exchange of exercises between a teacher and a student. The app allows teachers to create their own sets of questions or use those ready-made. Students, in turn, can easily reach the assigned exercises using a QR code or a special ID code. Once completed, teachers have an insight into students’ results.
